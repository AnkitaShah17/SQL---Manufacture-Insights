Manufacturing Data Analysis Using SQL

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of manufacturing data using SQL. The dataset includes information on production quantities, rejected quantities, buyers, customers, and departments. The primary goals were to calculate total quantities, identify top performers, and analyze rejection rates.

Key Analyses:

Database Setup:
Created the manufacture database and set up the prod_data table.

Total Quantities:
Calculated the total manufactured quantity and total rejected quantity.
Ensured data integrity by checking for non-numeric values and converting them to numeric types.

Top Performers:
Identified buyers, customers, and departments with the highest manufactured quantities.
Analyzed the highest rejected quantities by buyer, customer, and department.

Data Validation and Cleaning:
Validated the Manufactured Qty and Rejected Qty fields to ensure they contain numeric values.
Used regular expressions and type casting for data cleaning.

Comprehensive Data Retrieval:
Retrieved all records from the prod_data table for a complete overview.
This project demonstrates my ability to perform complex SQL queries for data analysis, validation, and cleaning, providing valuable insights into manufacturing performance and quality control.
